your job is to write a program to solve all the levels in the level folder up to the final, which is much harder than the early levels. this will require a series of very clever algorithms. the current directory contains detailed information including a sample brute force solver and some debugging and verifying tools. the brute force program will not progress far.
the final solution must run in under an hour. you will need to try ideas, test, iterate, many times. make a long term plan that assumes this is going to be hard and there will be repeated continuations to work on this until it is solved. do not stop until you have tested a final solution that works for the hardest level. do not search the internet for any existing approaches to this puzzle. do not go up any directories to look at anything outside the current directory and its sub directories.
in the event you are not able to solve all levels up to the end, it's important to report how far you are able to get. before stopping work, after any significant improvement, run the evaluate script from level 1 to see how far you get and only report results where you test from the beginning, not cherry picked levels.
